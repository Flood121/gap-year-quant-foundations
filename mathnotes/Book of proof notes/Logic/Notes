Week #1 logic & sets

-**Basic set info**- 
- A set is a collection of objects called elements, usually formatted as such {1,2,3} etc.
- Sets are only equal if they have the same elements, order is not considered
- Sets themselves can be elements of sets (subsets)
- Cardinality is the number of elements in a set, e.g A = {1,2,3} then |A| = 3 
- the empty set is the set with no elements, denoted ∅

**Cartesian product**
- An ordered pai]r is 2 objects in a specific order, e.g (x,y)
- The cartesian product multiplies sets by forming ordered pairs, e.g A = {1,2} B = {3,4} then A X B = {{1,3}, {1,4}, {2,3}, {2,4}}
  - A familiar example of this would be the 2-D cartesian plane R^2,= {x,y}

**Subsets**
- Arise when all elements in one set are in another set 
- For any set, the empty set is always a subset 
- For a set with n elements, it has 2^n subsets

**Power sets** 
- Denoted P(A), creates a set of all subsets of a particular set 
 - For a finite set, the cardinality of the power set is 2 to the power of the cardinality of the original set

**Set operations**
- A U B = in A or B
- A ∩ B = in A and B
A - B = in A but not in B
A' = Not containing A

**Sets as number systems**
- Any non-empty subset has a smallest element
  - Well-ordering principle 
- This gives rise to the division algorithm a = qb + r
